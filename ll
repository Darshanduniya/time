I am writing to inform you that my uncle passed away early this morning, and I need to take 2 days off to be with my family during this difficult time. I kindly request your approval for this leave.

If there are any urgent matters that require my attention, please do not hesitate to call me, and I will do my best to log in and support as needed.

Thank you for your understanding.
